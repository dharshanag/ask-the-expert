# Ask the expert
- I have made a program where you can ask the "expert" a capital of any country. 
- If it does not have the country in the txt file, it will ask you what the country is and store it. So if you ask for that country again, it will know
- I made this program with the help of the book Coding Projects in Python, a book by DK :
https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Projects-Python-DK/dp/1465461884
- If you would like to add or change anything in this program, it would be great if you could tell me what you changed.
